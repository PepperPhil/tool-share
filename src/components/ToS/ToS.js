<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

Tool Share expressly disclaims any duty to update or revise the materials on this website, although Tool Share may modify the materials at any time without notice.

Tool Share reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately, without notice, suspend or terminate (I) these Terms of Use; and/or (ii) your registration(s) with or ability to access Tool Share Site and/or any other service provided to you by Tool Share.
</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>
Tool Share uses Stripe as payment engine. The total transaction amount, defined as being the price per day/week/month times the rental duration booked, is authorized at the moment the renter confirms the booking request by proceeding with the payment. The payment is charged once the owner confirms the transaction. The owner has 3 days to confirm the rental request. If the owner declines or does not respond, no charge is made to the renter.
</p>
<h2>Prices & fees</h2>
<p>
The price displayed on the article listing is the price set by the owner and due for the renter.
The service fee to cover the service costs of Tool Share is set to 20% of the total transaction amount, with a minimum of $0.20. The payment processing fees are charged by Stripe and are a combination of a percentage of the total transaction price and a fixed fee.

The service fee and the Stripe fees are both automatically deducted from the owners/beneficiary’s proceeds.
</p>
<h2>Transaction agreement</h2>
<p>
Any transaction requires both parties to accept an agreement before the transaction. That transaction agreement further outlines the rules regarding the rental terms (i.e. rental conditions, the refunds and cancellation, the guarantee, the lister obligations), the renter obligations (i.e. usage, return, repossession, prohibited use, damage, payment, repairs, ownership) and the risk and liability terms (acknowledgement and assumption of risk, waiver and release, indemnification, third party claims, insurance, physical condition).
</p>
<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p>
You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
